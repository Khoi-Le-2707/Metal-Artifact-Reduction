# CT Image Quality Evaluation Script

This folder contains a MATLAB script (statistic.m) to evaluate the quality of MAR images using **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index) and **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio). The script compares the MAR image against a ground truth image while ignoring metals defined by metal mask. The output is two bar charts for each metric that compare different MAR methods defined in the array `model_list`.

The functions `ssim_SDL.m` and `psnr_SDL.m` used in this repository are adapted from:

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2024b)
- Required Images:
    - 'ground_truth.png' - The clean reference CT image
    - 'metal_mask.png' - Binary mask image where metals are located (1 = metal)
- Images from MAR methods you want to compare

--- 

## How to use

Make sure the metal artifact reduced images are all in the same folder and the picture names are defined in `model_list`.
```matlab
model_list = ["InDuDoNet", "InDuDoNet+", "OSCNet", "ACDNet", "DICDNet", "SR"];
```


### üìê Image Size & Resizing

All images in this evaluation are expected to have a resolution of **512 √ó 512 pixels**, which is the default size of the ground truth (`ground_truth.png`) and the metal mask (`metal_mask.png`).  
To ensure a fair and pixel-wise comparison, all model outputs must match this resolution.

By default, the script automatically resizes each model image to `(512, 512)` **unless** it matches a specific name (e.g., `"SR"`), which is assumed to already be in the correct format:

```matlab
if model_list(i) ~= "SR"
    mar_img = imresize(mar_img, [512 512]);
end
```
If you want to use a different resolution for the ground truth, make sure all other images (mask and outputs) match that new size, and adjust the resizing accordingly.

Now, by running the script, you should see two side-by-side bar plots
- Left: SSIM (range 0-1)
- Right: PSNR (in dB)
