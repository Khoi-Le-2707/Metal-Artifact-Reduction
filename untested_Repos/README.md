# Untested Repositories

Below is a list of untested Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) algorithms that may be useful for future exploration. If possible, they are worth reviewing:

1. [rise-mar](https://github.com/Masaaki-75/rise-mar)  
   A promising project from 2025 based on **semi-supervised deep learning**. It combines simulated, real, and pseudo-GT data, uses a **Clinical Quality Assessor (CQA)**, and follows an **iterative teacherâ€“student mechanism**. Focuses primarily on the **image domain**.

2. [DuDoDp-MAR](https://github.com/DeepXuan/DuDoDp-MAR)  
   Developed in 2023, this algorithm uses an **unsupervised diffusion model** trained on **clean CT images only**. It performs MAR in both the **sinogram and image domains** using a dual-domain reconstruction strategy.

3. [ADN](https://github.com/liaohaofu/adn)  
   Published in 2019. The repository might be outdated but still worth examining for architectural inspiration or benchmarking.

4. [CNN-MAR](https://github.com/yanbozhang007/CNN-MAR)  
   Implemented in 2018 using **Matlab 2016** on **Windows 10**. It may require adjustments to run on modern systems but could offer insights into early CNN-based MAR approaches.
