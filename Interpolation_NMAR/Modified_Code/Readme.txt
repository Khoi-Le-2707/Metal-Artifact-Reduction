This ZIP file is the code to work out the proposed method; A metal artifact reduction method for small-field-of-view CT imaging.

1. It can be operated using Main.m.

2. To run the code, you must have TIGRE: Matlab-GPU Toolbox.

3. parameter.m is a code that creates system geometry.

4. symmetric_mirroring.m is the truncation correction method function.

5. LMAR.m and NMAR.m are Linear-MAR and Normalized-MAR function codes, respectively.

6. makefircle.m is a function that makes a simple circle to make FOV.

7. The singoram_metal_*.mat file is an example of originally measured sinogram data. The above parameters are the information of this data.

Thank you.
